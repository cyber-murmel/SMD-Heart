# SMD Heart
This PCB is supposed the be a pendant for a necklace or similar.
The circuit is a simple 13 stage ring oscillator which makes 13 LEDs fade.
It's powered by a single CR2032 coin cell.

The files are created using KiCAD Version 5.0.0-rc2.
Thus I had to include some footprints and 3D files in this project.
